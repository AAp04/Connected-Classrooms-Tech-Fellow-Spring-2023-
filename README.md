# Connected-Classrooms-Tech-Fellow-Spring-2023-

Prompt 1 (4 minutes): 
In your 4 minute video, imagine you’re in the breakout rooms and your pod would like you to explain Cross Site Scripting in more detail. How would you further explain XSS to your pod? 

Things to keep in mind: 
TAs may not know all the answers or how to further explain a concept, how would you respond to your pod if this is the case? 
Students may not fully understand even after diving deeper into the concept, as a TF, think about how you would guide these students
TAs will have access to the course portal and Instructor slides as resources to guide facilitation

Prompt 2 (4 minutes):
You have joined a pod during breakout session with about 5 students in the room. All the cameras are off and there is no active participation. How would you encourage engagement within your pod and facilitate discussion?

Guidelines & Suggestions
We’ve seen successful facilitation take a lot of different forms. However, there are a few suggestions. We suggest them to you as a guide in evaluating your own facilitation style, although we recognize the challenges of incorporating all of these factors into a short video
Consider your pod’s engagement level and their interaction with each other and you
Avoid technical jargon when explaining new concepts unless explicitly defined
Avoid going too deep into technical details that simply aren’t needed at their level
Do use analogies, visuals, or reference points to help them connect to new topics
Help students to learn the areas to check first when different issues come up
Students may be unwilling to participate in their pods
As a TF, your role is to guide students through questions and problems (you do not need to know all the answers)
